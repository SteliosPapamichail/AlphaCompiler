# α-lang Compiler

## What's its purpose?

This compiler was developed as a project for the [CS-340](https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy340/) course of the [Computer Science Department](https://www.csd.uoc.gr/) of the University of Crete.

## Learning goals

1. Lexical Analysis using [Flex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flex_(lexical_analyser_generator))
2. Syntax Analysis using [Bison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Bison)
3. Intermediate code generation using Syntax Directed Translation
4. Target code generation

## Using the compiler

### How to build the project
Simply run `make` or `make all` in order to compile the α-compiler and produce the `alang` executable.

### How to compile an α (alpha) program
To compile your Alpha (.asc) program, simply run `./alang [path-to-file.asc] [optional -d]`. This command will
compile the program and generate the binary file to be passed to the [Alpha virtual machine](). If you want to see the SymbolTable entries, Quads, Constants Tables & Target code information that are generated by the compiler,
just add the `-d` flag after the source file's path.

#### Sidenotes
You can also perform the steps specified by `make all`
one by one. Simply run `make flex` in order to generate the lexical analyzer (`scanner.c` file), `make bison` to generate the syntax parser (`parser.c/h file`), `make tcode_gen` to create the target code generator and lastly, `make comp` in order to compile all the required source files and link them together to produce the final `alang` executable.
